Knowledge of AI tooling is critical for future-proofing the careers of React developers, and understanding the Vercel suite of AI tools is an approachable on-ramp for anyone comfortable with React. This stack makes it easier to incorporate the new paradigms of generative AI and streaming user interfaces in a React app. In this course, take a closer look at the Vercel AI SDK and see how this can help React developers build streaming interfaces with JavaScript and TypeScript. Join Instructor Eve Porcello to find out how to start adding AI-enhanced functionality to your apps as she guides you through creating a React App with Next.js. Learn about working with streams, using generative AI functions, working with components, generating structured data, and much more, and get the knowledge and skills you need to ride this new technological wave.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
